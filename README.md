# A simple, SFML-based sound generator
## Purpose:
- test (SFML sound generation)
- reuse / boilerplate
- possible starting point for a more versatile sound generator
## Current features:
- sound wave generation:
    - square wave
- addition of trailing pause to sample
- create sound from repeated sample
## (un)Planned features:
- sine, triangle, etc. waves
- noise
- filters (low-pass, high-pass, band)
- etc.
